## What is DataRepVR?

DataRepVR is short for Data Representation in Virtual Reality. It's a research project we've been working on.

Our goal with this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of visualising complex spatial data using virtual reality compared to traditional computer visualisations (e.g., 2D graphs on a conventional display). We're using the Leap Motion hand tracker to enable interaction with the visualisation. This allows you to reach out and manipulate the display with no controllers attached to your hands.

From a usability standpoint, we need to demonstrate the effectivness of our method compared to traditional interaction methods. This is why we have also prepared multiple levels to support using a Xbox controller instead of the Leap controller.

Our data is sourced from the NOAA GFS system, and consists of a number of weather variables (e.g. temperature, humidity, pressure) over the North American continent.
